#My interactive and stylish website ðŸŽ‰.
I have created a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It contains the Home, About, Contacts, my javascript file and css file.
This was a challenging website.
Its contents are;

##Home
*It is just a page which just introduces someone to the website.
*It also contains a feature where someone can toggle light an dark modes.

##About
*It describes more about the website.
*There are also some transitions and cool animations.

##Contacts
*Contais my contact details just incase some one wished to contact me.
*It also contains a form but I don't knw how to contain the information yet but hopefully I will lear it too
